# CAPTCHA Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks

### Introduction:
CAPTCHAs may be referred to those infuriating images containing the text that needs to be typed in before a person can access a particular website. The full form of CAPTCHA is "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart" and as the name suggests it is a way to avert the computer to fill out the form on its own, automatically. However using the concept of deep learning and computer vision, the very purpose of the CAPTCHAs can be defeated. This test can be passed automatically with the help of Convolutional Neural networks(CNN) - a class of the deep neural networks. A CNN is an algorithm of deep learning which takes in an image as input and then assigns some value to various features in the image which further helps to differentiate one feature from the other.

### Dataset Description:
The dataset used for this project consists of 1070 .png images of text based CAPTCHA. The dataset has been taken from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248380891_CAPTCHA_dataset. Each dataset image is of 5 character set and the character set is defined as all English small letters and digits from 0 to 9. To train the model to read this CAPTCHA efficiently, 970 images are used for training purposes and the remaining 100 images are used for testing purposes.
